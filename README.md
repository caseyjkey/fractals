# How to Run
1. Install the latest Python from (python.org)[python.org]
2. Run `python3 carpet.py 2 100` within this directory
3. To exit early, go back to the terminal window and press Ctrl and C then press  Enter.

# Notes
The first argument, i.e. 2, is the depth for this fractal, so it will repeat the pattern twice. Try running this with a depth of 1 (`python3 carpet.py 1 100`) and with a larger depth, like 3. Anything past 3 is slow and not as cool.

The second argument is the size, try increasing this number to better view larger depths. 

This is an example of a recursive function.
